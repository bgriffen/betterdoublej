# BetterDoubleJ

Simple streaming app for running Double J but switching to the news on Triple J.

## Requirements

To create a windows executable, you will need [VLC Player](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/) and need to run `windowsexe.sh` with pyinstaller.

If just running this program directly, simple run `betterDoubleJ.py` after installing `python-vlc`.

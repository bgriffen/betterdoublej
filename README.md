# :notes: BetterDoubleJ

Simple streaming app for running Double J but switching to the news on Triple J.

## Requirements

To create a windows executable, you will need [VLC Player](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/) and need to run `windowsexe.sh` with pyinstaller. If just running this program directly, you'll just need

* [python-vlc](https://pypi.org/project/python-vlc/)

## Getting Stated 

Simple run `betterDoubleJ.py` if you aren't building the executable with pyinstaller.
